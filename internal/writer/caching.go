// The stale-while-revalidate response directive indicates that the cache
// could reuse a stale response while it revalidates it to a cache.
//
// Revalidation will make the cache be fresh again, so it appears to clients
// that it was always fresh during that period â€” effectively hiding the latency
// penalty of revalidation from them.
//
// If no request happened during that period, the cache became stale and the
// next request will revalidate normally.
